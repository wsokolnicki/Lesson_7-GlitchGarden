# Lesson_7-GlitchGarden
Glitch Garden

Glich Garden is a 'Plants vs Zombies' type game (tower defence). 
Player starts the game with some amount of point, that can be spent on defenders or extra point generators.
There's a limited time for level to pass and all the player has to do is to survive incoming waves of enemies, 
without getting kill in the process.

New implemantations:
- Splash screen
- Main menu with options (volume, difficulty)
- Characters animations


Game is not finished. I stoped working on it, after implementing all of the mechanics to it.
During first level, there are some enemies - after you pass this part, new level begins (still says it is level 1),
after that another one and then win screen.
